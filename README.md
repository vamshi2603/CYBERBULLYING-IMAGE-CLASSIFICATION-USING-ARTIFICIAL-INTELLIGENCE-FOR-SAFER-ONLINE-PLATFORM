Cyberbullying refers to the act of using digital communication tools, such as social media,
text messages, or emails, to harass, threaten, or intimidate individuals. It often involves sending
hurtful or offensive messages, spreading rumors, sharing private information, or posting
derogatory comments or images online. Cyberbullying can have severe emotional and
psychological effects on the victims.

Cyberbullying was a growing concern in India, especially among teenagers and young
adults. It was estimated that a significant portion of Indian youth had experienced some form of
cyberbullying or online harassment.

India had cyber laws in place to address online harassment and cyberbullying. The
Information Technology Act, 2000, was amended to include provisions related to cyberbullying
and online harassment.

Detecting cyberbullying in images can be a challenging task, but deep learning (DL) image
processing techniques can be used to help identify and address this issue.
